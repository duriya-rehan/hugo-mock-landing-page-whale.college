I purchased the domain name (screenshot attached) - however i was having issues verifying with my email - when I clicked the link they sent it never loaded properly and the website stopped responding. That's why I couldn't verify it. I think because of this it gave me a DNS error when I was trying to add domain link to settings on GitHub.
